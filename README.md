# Image-Reconstruction

The steps for the Image Reconstruction are given below

TIGRE: Tomographic Iterative GPU-based Reconstruction Toolbox:

TIGRE is a powerful toolbox for tomographic image reconstruction. It’s designed for iterative reconstruction and utilizes GPUs for faster processing. You can find the code and discussions in the TIGRE GitHub repository 

Computed Tomography Image Reconstruction Project:

This project focuses on computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction using MATLAB. You’ll find code related to filtered back projection (FBP) and other techniques. Check out the CT-Image-Reconstruction repository 1

GlobalBioIm: A Unifying Framework for Reconstruction Algorithms:

The GlobalBioIm repository provides a Matlab framework for developing reconstruction algorithms (solving inverse problems) in computational imaging. If you’re interested in inverse problems, this is a great resource. Explore it on GitHub 

OMEGA: Open-source Emission and Transmission Tomography Software:

OMEGA is an open-source software package for emission and transmission tomography. It supports both MATLAB and GNU Octave. Dive into the world of medical imaging and tomography with the OMEGA repository 1.

Single-Pixel Imaging with SPIRIT:

The SPIRIT repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions for single-pixel imaging. If you’re curious about computational imaging and single-pixel cameras, explore the SPIRIT repository 1.

Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT):

Interested in EIT? The EIT repository includes MATLAB code related to electrical impedance tomography. Discover more about this fascinating field here 1.

3D Cone Beam CT Reconstruction:

If you’re into medical imaging, the CBCT repository focuses on 3D cone beam CT reconstruction. Explore the code related to filtered back projection (FBP) and other techniques here
